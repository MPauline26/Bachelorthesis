# Bachelorthesis Repository

This repository contains the Python code and LaTeX source code for my bachelor thesis. The purpose of this repository is to document the code used in my thesis and provide access to the LaTeX source for the thesis document.

## LaTeX Compilation

I used Texmaker to write my thesis and compile the LaTeX source code into a PDF document. Simply open Inhalt.tex in your LaTeX editor of choice and compile it to generate the PDF document.
